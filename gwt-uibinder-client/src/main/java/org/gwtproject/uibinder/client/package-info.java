/**
 * Classes used to generate user interfaces using declarative ui.xml files.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package contains the classes and interfaces that allow you to define
 * user interfaces from ui.xml template files, managed by generated
 * implementations of the {@link org.gwtproject.uibinder.client.UiBinder UiBinder}
 * interface. UiBinder templates allow you to lay out your widgets and design
 * new ones via HTML, CSS and Image resources (the last two via generated
 * ClientBundles) with a minimum of coding. They also have extensive support
 * for internationalization, by generating Messages.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Follow the links below for general documentation. Specialized markup for
 * individual widget types is described in their javadoc. In particular, see
 * UIObject for markup that applies to all widgets.
 * </p>
